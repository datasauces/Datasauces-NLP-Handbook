    "## Introduction to the Case study\n",
    "\n",
    "**Business Context.** You are a data scientist for a large e-commerce firm. You have tens of thousands of customers writing reviews on products each day. Each review contains textual feedback along with a 1-to-5 star rating system (1 being least satisfied and 5 being most satisfied). The firm wants to quantify customer satisfaction coming from these non-rated interactions to help with further business decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Business Problem.** Your task is to *build models which can identify the sentiment (positive or negative) of each of these non-rated interactions*.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analytical Context.** The data is a set of reviews in CSV file format. We will combine some text processing procedures to be learnt in this session and classification models to develop algorithms capable of classifying interactions by sentiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll be doing the following in this case:\n",
    "1. Read and analyze the input text data and the corresponding response variables (ratings)\n",
    "2. Perform basic pre-processing to prepare the data for modeling\n",
    "3. Learn and apply various ways of featurizing the reviews text\n",
    "4. Build machine learning models to classify text as either exhibiting positive or negative sentiment (1 or 0)."

    "Consider the book *One Hundred Years of Solitude*. It has more than 1 million characters. Can we see this as a vector of strings that take values in a space of 1 million dimensions and then apply machine learning methods? This is a very bad idea for two reasons:\n",
